//   X.Y.Z  →  X = current year, Y = visual/UI changes, Z = backend changes
//
// Historical note: prior version numbers (v1 through v15) got out of sync at
// one point — we simply continued with the existing numbering rather than
// correcting it mid-stream.
// The jump to v26 resets the scheme to something meaningful going forward.

        desc: "OpenHamClock now talks to MeshCom, the LoRa-based VHF/UHF mesh network popular in Europe. Set up the new MeshCom plugin in rig-bridge and OHC will plot every node it hears on the map, list them in a tab with whatever weather or telemetry they're broadcasting, and let you read and reply to chat traffic right from the panel. Click any message to pop up reply buttons (broadcast, group, or direct), or type any callsign or group name into the To field — known nodes auto-suggest as you go. Works whether your rig-bridge talks straight to your browser or routes through Cloud Relay. Translated into all 16 languages. Big thanks to Joe Lukowski (DH1OK) for building this.",

        desc: "At higher transmit powers the Propagation panel was lighting every band green — the WASM prediction looked broken. The cause: your TX power and antenna gain were being counted twice (once inside the prediction engine, then again on top of its result). Now they're only counted once, so 1,000 W and 100 W produce the realistic difference you'd expect, and bands above the MUF stop pretending to be open. The dB margin shown next to each band still reflects your real power and antenna advantage — only the math behind the colors changed.",
